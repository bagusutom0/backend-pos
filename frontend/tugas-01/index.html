        Cherry blossoms are a symbol of Japanese spring, beloved for their
        ephemeral beauty. Japanese look forward eagerly to the flowering of the
        cherries, to the point that the nightly news carries detailed forecasts
        of the blossom’s steady spread across the islands of Japan, from warmer
        southwestern climates to the cooler northeast, right alongside the daily
        weather forecasts. They call the march of flowers the sakura zensen:
        “the cherry blossom front.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The official watchers use a specific species of cherry for their
        observations, known as the somei yoshino. It is the most commonly
        encountered type of cherry tree in Japan, to the point that when people
        think of sakura in my country, they’re almost certainly envisioning
        somei yoshino blossoms.

        I was born and raised in Japan, and have spent most of my life here, so
        I’ve been through more cherry-blossom cycles than I sometimes care to
        remember. But even still, I only recently learned about the “600 degree
        rule.” It defines how the somei yoshino emerge from their winter
        dormancy to blossom every Spring.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s simple. You start calculating on February 1st, adding together the
        high temperatures of every day thereafter. When the total reaches 600
        degrees Celsius, they say, the somei yoshino will begin blooming.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Tokyo, the blossoming of the somei yoshino is traditionally
        associated with the month of April. But this year, they began to bloom
        on March 28th. In fact, the cherries have been blooming significantly
        earlier in recent years as compared to the 20th century and earlier. The
        reason is simple: rising temperatures due to climate change.

      <p>
        The blooming of the cherries is linked to all sorts of traditions in
        Japan. Those little flowers have long been seen as a symbol of new
        beginnings. This is because a great many things typically begin here in
        April. School years start. New recruits begin working. And for their
        companies, the fiscal year begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a schoolgirl, my combined junior-senior high school in Tokyo
        had a grand old somei yoshino standing in the schoolyard. There was a
        tradition of taking class pictures beneath it on the first day of
        school. Teachers would set up stands under its boughs, and each class
        would take their turn on them for a commemorative photo. Some years, the
        tree would only be in half bloom. Others, it might have been full
        mankai. But the tree inevitably had at least some flowers on its
        branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        That isn’t inevitable anymore. Warmer temperatures on average mean the
        trees awaken from their winter dormancy significantly earlier, making
        early bloomings the “new normal.” Even as we continue to see the sakura
        as a symbol of beginnings, in some places somei yoshino have started to
        bloom so early that they are becoming associated with graduations, which
        typically happen in mid-March. It’s a strange thing to see for older
        generations of Japanese people who remember the sakura as a symbol of
        April.
      </p>
      <p>
        If things continue like this, it is entirely possible that sakura will
        continue to bloom even earlier. Will a day come when they bloom in
        February? I hope not. It would be a sign of something gone terribly
        wrong with the ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as for the moment, I put dark thoughts like that out of my head. The
        neighborhood somei yoshino are approaching full bloom, the pink and
        white puffs filling out the branches like fluffy popcorn, countless
        little flowers cheering on new starters – including me! I am excited to
        launch my newsletter, and grateful that it can be during such a
        beautiful April. In issues to come, I want to profile and contextualize
        aspects of Japanese culture in a fun and engaging way for English
        readers. I hope you will find it useful. In the meantime, nice meeting
        you! And thanks for reading.
